class OffensiveQLearningAgent(CaptureAgent):
    """
    The OffensiveQLearningAgent is a strategic agent designed for playing an offensive role in the Capture the Flag 
    scenario of the Pac-Man game. It leverages Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to make informed 
    decisions and optimize its offensive gameplay. 
    
    Here are the key features and strategies employed by the OffensiveQLearningAgent:

        1. Trained Weights Loading: The agent has the capability to load pre-trained weights from a file (trained_agent_weights.pkl). 
        This feature allows the agent to benefit from past learning experiences, enhancing its decision-making.
        
        2. Q-learning Algorithm Parameters: During training, the agent dynamically adjusts its exploration-exploitation trade-off. 
        The exploration rate (epsilon) is set to 0.15 for training, encouraging exploration, and 0 during gameplay, promoting exploitation 
        of learned knowledge. The learning rate (alpha) is set to 0.2, determining the impact of new information on the agent's existing knowledge.
        
        3. Action Selection: The agent dynamically selects actions based on its current knowledge and game state. It favors 
        returning home when carrying a significant amount of food or when close to victory conditions.
        
        4. Feature Extraction: Relevant features, such as proximity to ghosts, distance to nearby food, and the urgency to return home with food,
        are extracted to inform the agent's decision-making process.
        
        5. Weighted Q-value Computation: Q-values, representing the expected cumulative rewards for specific actions, 
        are calculated based on a weighted combination of features and learned weights. This forms the basis for the agent's decision-making.
        
        6. Weight Updating: The agent updates its knowledge by adjusting weights using the Q-learning update rule. This update considers 
        observed rewards, discount factors, and predicted future rewards.
        
        7. Reward Calculation: Rewards are calculated based on various factors, including proximity to enemies, progress towards returning home, 
        changes in the game score, and distance to the nearest food.
        
        8. Persistence and Learning: Trained weights are persisted to a file (trained_agent_weights.pkl) after each game, ensuring that the agent retains 
        and builds upon its learned knowledge over multiple game sessions.
        
        9. Ghost Position Inference: The agent utilizes Bayesian inference to estimate the positions of opponents, particularly ghosts, 
        based on observations and the passage of time.
        
    In summary, the OffensiveQLearningAgent demonstrates a strategic and adaptive approach to offensive gameplay, 
    employing Q-learning principles to optimize its actions in the dynamic environment of Capture the Flag. 
    The agent's continuous learning, feature-based decision-making, and integration with game-specific strategies 
    contribute to its effectiveness as an offensive player.

    The DefensiveReflexCaptureAgent is responsible for defending the team's side of the map in the Pac-Man game.
    It uses a combination of strategies to defend against enemy Pac-Man invaders.

    More specifically:
    1. Patrol Behavior: The agent patrols strategic points along the border of its territory, with a focus on chokepoints.
       This ensures that it covers critical areas and intercepts invaders.

    2. Belief Distribution: When no visible invaders are present, the agent uses a belief distribution to estimate
       the potential locations of enemy Pac-Man agents. It adjusts its patrol behavior based on these estimations to
       maintain effective defense. This Bayesian inference approach allows the agent to make probabilistic estimates
       about where the enemy Pac-Man agents might be located. So its enables the agent to make informed decisions about
       its defensive actions, even when it cannot directly see the enemy Pac-Man invaders.

    3. Chokepoint Identification: The agent analyzes the map layout to identify chokepoints, which are key areas for
       interception. It strategically positions itself near these chokepoints to increase its defensive capabilities.

    4. Feature-Based Decision Making: The agent makes decisions based on a set of features computed from the game state.
       These features include information about the presence of invaders, distances to invaders, and more.

    5. Weighted Features: The agent assigns weights to these features to prioritize certain aspects of its decision-making.
       For example, it may prioritize staying on defense, targeting nearby invaders, and avoiding stopping or reversing
       whenever possible.

    Overall, the DefensiveReflexCaptureAgent is designed to be a formidable defender, ensuring that the team's territory
    remains secure by intercepting and repelling enemy Pac-Man invaders.
